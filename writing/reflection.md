## In clear and meaningful language, discuss your three (foundational) questions.

When we think of the United States, words like “freedom” or “democracy” usually come to one’s mind. The U.S. has a long history of democratic traditions, and the political vision of equality, liberty, and “unalienable rights” has created a foundation for a diverse society of many different racial, religious, and social groups. On the international level, the U.S. has long been viewed as a protector of democratic principles across the globe, its political ideals “have echoed through time and across borders” (Edel 2019). While there are problems in our political system, such as the disenfranchisement of minority groups throughout the country’s history or the misdeeds we have made as a nation, we should still celebrate this rich legacy of political philosophy. For in many instances, it was these ideals that guided us in addressing our shortcomings and thus shaping America into what it is today.

And yet, that democratic tradition is under siege. In recent years, democratic backsliding has been a common trend globally, and the U.S. is no exception. Freedom House report in 2021 claimed that over the past ten years, “the United States’ aggregate … score has declined by 11 points, placing it among the 25 countries that have suffered the largest decline in this period” (Repucci & Slipowitz 2021, 2). The memories of January 6th are still fresh for many of us: for the first time in our country’s history, there was an attempt to overturn an election and disrupt the electoral processes that have been in place for over two centuries. This has profound implications for our political landscape and certainly is a stain on our name as one of the world’s leading democracies. Scholars have identified three causal mechanisms behind the regression of democracy worldwide: the pernicious effects of polarization, rulers’ control of the legislature, and the incremental nature of abuses of power (Haggard & Kaufman 2021). If we agree that a healthy democracy is something to be desired, then it is upon us to protect and preserve the democratic principles that are the foundations of this country by addressing the problems that led us down this path.

Among the causes mentioned above, what is most troubling is the widespread partisanship and polarization among ordinary citizens in recent years. In a study looking at support for democracy in the U.S., it is suggested that Americans are willing “to trade-off democratic principles for other valid but potentially conflicting considerations such as political ideology, partisan loyalty, and policy preferences” (Graham & Svolik 2020). Furthermore, while ideological polarization leads to “extreme division between opponents over the issues” in the political system, affective polarization causes members of opposing parties to “dislike and distrust each other” (Orhan 2022, 715). It divides society and creates mutually distrustful “us” versus “them” groups who view each other as existential threats instead of fellow citizens whom they might disagree with. A democracy is a political model that permits differences of ideas and yet overcomes them via a thoughtful majority rule where everyone’s concern is taken into consideration. This, unfortunately, does not seem to be where we are at.

I am interested in studying of politics and public opinion using polling datas. I was introduced to this dataset through a Political Science professor of mine, and thanks to the knowledge in R that I acquire in this class, I am now capable of dissecting this dataset in order to look at some issues that are of interest to me. In particular, I have a couple of questions that I want to look into:

1. Does political affiliation affect how people view politicians/political candidates?

2. Does

## What motivation is there behind these questions?

For each question, be sure to describe and discuss; the method, the code, the results and the conclusions of your group. This work will take about the same time as two labs.
