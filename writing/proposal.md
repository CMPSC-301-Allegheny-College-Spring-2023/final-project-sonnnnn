## Name:

Truong Son Nguyen

## Group name:

Political Polling

## Proposal Title:

Political Polling and Public Opinion

## Questions:

1. Is there a correlation between trust in the news media and party identification? In other words, given a person's political affiliation, can we reasonably predict how they feel about the news media?

2. Are people bias in their choice of presidential candidate? In other words, do voters have an incentive to support the candidate representing their party?

3. Is there a correlation between party identification for voters and how they approve or disapprove of political institutions? In particular, is party ID a determinant of how people judge Congress and the Presidency?

4. Can we, as citizens, still trust one another? Would party identification affect the level of trust people have for one another?

## Data:

The data that I will be using for this project comes from the American National Election Studies, an academic institution that has done extensive work on the study of public opinions and political polling every presidential election cycle. The data that I will use come from the 2020 election cycle. Besides some of the questions dealing with how people intend to vote, they also collected other data with regards to how citizens think about political institutions, characters, and their fellow citizens. I will use these information in my studies to help me answer the questions above.

## Methods:

First of all, I will have to perform some degrees of data wrangling, recoding some of them in order to perform further analysis, and cleaning the dataset essentially. I am particularly interested in a few variables, such as Trust in the Media, Party Identification, whether the citizens approve or disapprove of Congress and the President, and their intent to support a candidate in the 2020 election cycle.

I will then have to remove some of the blank values for all of these variables, so that I will only consider the individuals who have answered all of the relevant questions. I understand that this could have some degree of impact on the findings, since according to scholars, the fact that respondents deny answering some of these questions could be traced back to social desirability bias (Coppock 2017, Klar 2016), when people are hesitant to disclose their true feelings due to fear of judgements from others.

After that, I will then find out how respondents are answering to these questions and gain some key insight into what are the consensus on these matters. Furthermore, since I am interested in determining whether there exists certain trends within each partisan group, I will then group the different variable groups together, which is Party ID with each of the other five.

In order to find the results, I will put them in percentage stacked bar chart. In this way, it would make it easier for anyone to quickly identifies if a certain idea or opinion is more commonly shared between a particular partisan group or not. Finally, I will perform regression analysis to determine if there is a statistically significant relationship between the variables I just mentioned.

## Justification Discussion:

Scholar Sebastian Jilke in his article suggests that there is a "partisan bias" in citizens satisfaction with government and the legislative branch" (Jilke 2017). This also has been a common theme among political scientists in the study of political polarization in the U.S., as they believe that the political party that a person identifies with can influence their support for political actors, making them more partisan and more likely to support those who share the same political identity with them. Furthermore, many recent polls have found that Americans are becoming more and more distrustful of their politicians, political institutions, and their fellow citizens (Orth 2022). I think it is important that we study these phenomenons, as they have significant impacts on the state of our political structure and the social fabric of our society.
